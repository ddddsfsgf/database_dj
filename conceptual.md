### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is PostgreSQL?(PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.)

- What is the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?(SQL is mainly meant for relational databases while postgreql can go further with additional features.)

- In `psql`, how do you connect to a database?(Just by typing \c and the name of the database)

- What is the difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`?(`HAVING` determines which grouped results to keep. `WHERE` decides which rows to use.)

- What is the difference between an `INNER` and `OUTER` join?(`INNER` only includes matching rows while `OUTER` can include rows that do not match.)

- What is the difference between a `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` join?(`LEFT OUTER` returns all rows from the left table and ones from the right that match. `RIGHT OUTER` returns all rows from the right and ones from the left that match.)

- What is an ORM? What do they do?(ORM, or Object Relational Mapping, allows us to navigate sql queries in other programming languages)

- What are some differences between making HTTP requests using AJAX 
  and from the server side using a library like `requests`?(Making requests from the server side allows us to hide informaation from the client side.)

- What is CSRF? What is the purpose of the CSRF token?(Cross-Site Request Forgery is a token generated by the server which allows the server to recognize and verify form requests.)

- What is the purpose of `form.hidden_tag()`?(Where the CSRF token is located.)
